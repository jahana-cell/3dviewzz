## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to evoke trust and openness, inspired by the representation of open spaces in architectural renderings.  
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean and modern canvas that does not distract from the visual content.
- Accent color: Muted Lavender (#B695C0) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean, modern, neutral feel that ensures readability and accessibility across devices.
- Use a set of clean, geometric icons to represent service features and benefits. Icons should be consistent with the overall modern aesthetic and support quick comprehension.
- Implement a grid-based layout with ample white space to create a balanced and uncluttered visual experience. Prioritize responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on all devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations on page transitions and interactive elements (e.g., button hovers) to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback, without being distracting.
